----------

The Multi-Application Guiding Interface for Commissioning (MAGIC) package provides convenient access to  numerous ancillary tools that will be used, as the name suggests, with the JWST FGS during OTE Commissioning. The package allows for user interaction with commissioning data and creates files that are needed for the operation of the flight software and the execution of visits.

**For more details on these tools and how to use them, please see the [MAGIC User's Guide](./docs/magic_user_guide).**

These tools comprise of four main components that can be run individually or together:

### 1. NIRCam or FGS science to FGS raw image conversion (``convert_image``)
This module will convert an input image (from *any* NIRCam or FGS detectors) to a pseudo-FGS raw image. This pseudo-FGS raw image is *not* a simulated image, but an expectation of the image that the FGS flight software will see. This module appropriately rotates the image from the science frame if necessary, adjusts the pixel scale and image size if converting from a NIRCam image, corrects bad pixels, and normalizes the image to the magnitude and count rates of a specified guide star.

### 2. Star Selection Tool (``star_selector``)
This module takes in a raw FGS image and allows the user to choose the guide and reference star PSFs using a GUI.


### 3. Flight Software File Writer (``fsw_file_writer``)
This module creates all the files necessary to test guide and reference star candidates in an FGS raw image, with different flight software simulators such as the FGS DHAS, FGSES, etc. This includes all the files necessary to run the ID, ACQ1, ACQ2, and TRK steps in these simulators.


### 4. Segment Guiding Tool (``segment_guiding``)
Allows the user to override the guide star catalog with the selected guide and reference star PSFs that will be used to facilitate guiding on unstacked and/or un-phased PSFs during JWST commissioning.


Installation notes
------------------
This package is developed in a Python â‰¥3.6 environment. Python 2 is not supported.

##### To install

1. ``$ cd`` into the directory where you want to keep the package

2. Clone the repository to your local machine (we recommend you have SSH keys set up). 
    If you are on GitHub:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:spacetelescope/jwst_magic.git
    ```
    OR, using GitLab:
    ```
    git clone git@grit.stsci.edu:JWST-FGS/jwst-magic.git
    ```

3. Activate a AstroConda (Python 3) environment (For installing AstroConda go [here](http://stsci-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing_anaconda.html)) or create a MAGIC-specific environment by navigating to the directory where the `setup.py` file lives in the `jwst_magic` package and create a new conda environment, for example named 'magic', from the `environment.yml` file:

    ```
    conda env create --name magic --file=environment.yml
    ```

4. You will need the `jwst-fgs-countrate` module in order to run MAGIC. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:spacetelescope/jwst-fgs-countrate.git
    ```

5. Install the `jwst-fgs-countrate` package by navigating to the directory where the `setup.py` file lives in the `jwst-fgs-countrate` package and installing it using `pip`:

    ```
    cd jwst-fgs-countrate/

    pip install -e .
    ```

6. Install the `jwst_magic` package by navigating to the directory where the `setup.py` file lives in the `jwst_magic` package and installing it using `pip`:

    ```
    cd jwst_magic/

    pip install -e .
    ```

The `jwst_magic` package installation process will also check for the following package dependencies, and automatically install them using pip if they are not found:
  * `astropy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `numpy`
  * `photutils`
  * `PyQt5`
  * `pysiaf`
  * `pytest`
  * `pyyaml`
  * `requests`


Running the Tools
-----------------
These tools are best run in the `IPython` terminal, in the conda environment where you have installed `jwst_magic`. Activate your environment, and launch the GUI with the following steps:

    In[1]: import jwst_magic

    In[2]: jwst_magic.run_tool_GUI()

Known Issues
-----------------
As with all software packages, there are several known issues for MAGIC. A [current list of known issues is available](https://jwstitarwiki.stsci.edu/display/WFSCOWG/MAGIC+Known+Issues), but please note that there is restricted access to this page.

Documentation
-----------------
For the full documentation, including step-by-step directions for using this package, see the [MAGIC User's Guide](./docs/magic_user_guide).

Contributing
-----------------
There are two pages to review before you begin contributing to the `jwst_magic` package.
The first is our [style guide](./style_guide/style_guide.md) and the second is our suggested [git workflow page](./style_guide/git_workflow.md),
which contains an in-depth explanation of the workflow.

The following is an example of a best work flow for contributing to the project
(adapted from the [`spacetelescope` `jwql` contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwql)):

1. Create a branch off of the `jwst_magic` repository using the [JIRA](https://jira.stsci.edu/projects/JWSTFGS/summary) issue name plus a
   short description of the issue (e.g. `JWSTFGS-375-fix-fgs-image-conversion`)
2. Make your software changes.
3. Push that branch to your personal GitHub repository (i.e. origin).
4. On the `jwst_magic` repository, create a pull request that merges the branch into `jwst_magic:master`.
5. Assign a reviewer from the team for the pull request.
6. Iterate with the reviewer over any needed changes until the reviewer accepts and merges your branch.
7. Delete your local copy of your branch.

Versioning
-----------------
This repository follows the principles of ["Semantic Versioning"](https://semver.org/), such that

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

When releasing a new version, developers should change the version number in `setup.py`, merge this change in a PR, and then release the package via the GitHub interface.

Code of Conduct
-----------------
Users and contributors to `jwst_magic` should adhere to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Any issues or violations pertaining to the Code of Conduct should be brought to
the attention of a MAGIC team member listed below.
