==========

1. If you have not yet installed the tools, go to Appendix A.
2. Check that you are in your astroconda environment. 
3. Make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of the tools (``pull`` the most recent version of the tools from the repo)::

    $ cd /Users/<username>/tools
    $ git pull origin master
