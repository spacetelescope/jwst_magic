# G1 2048 x 2048 CDS :  22.7 e-
# G1 128 x 128 CDS :    15.4 e-
# G1 32 x 32 CDS :      16.0 e-

# G2 128 x 128 CDS :    16.0 e-
# G2 32 x 32 CDS :      13.7 e-
#
# The CDS read noise as listed above was converted to single-frame read
# noise by multiplying by sqrt(2), to account for the fact that the CDS
# read noise is the result of two frames.
