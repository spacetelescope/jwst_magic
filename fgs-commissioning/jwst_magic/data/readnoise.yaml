# Read noise, in counts (e-),for both guider full-frame and subarrays
# Generated by Lauren Chambers, August 2018

# Original values (from Sherie Holfeltz, August 2018):
# G1 2048 x 2048 CDS :  23.9 e-
# G1 128 x 128 CDS :    17.2 e-
# G2 2048 x 2048 CDS:   23.4 e-
#
# The CDS read noise as listed above was converted to single-frame read
# noise by multiplying by sqrt(2), to account for the fact that the CDS
# read noise is the result of two frames.
#
# The read noise for G1 128 x 128 is used for all G1 subarrays.
#
# The read noise for G2 subarrays was calculated using the following relation:
# G2_sub = G1_sub * (G2_full / G1_full)
