This notebook will walk through image analysis of images from OTE-01, OTE-02, OTE-03, OTE-04, and OTE-06 AFTER they have been executed. We do not expect analysis of OTE-05 to be necessary. We focus on PSF shapes and how many \"guideable\" segment PSFs we have at each stage. \n",

In some cases you might find the there is more information than you think is helpful, it is up to you to determine what is helpful and what is not. \n",
