    "Some FGS images made by MIRAGE show very wide spreads in count rates. Looking into this, it looks like there are a few highly negative pixels and a few (or one) highly positive pixel. When MAGIC tries to normalize this image, it throws all of the available counts into the one (or couple) highly positive pixel(s). This means that we have no PSF data in the converted image. \n",

    "In my analysis I was able to come up with a quick fix using the correct_image utility function in MAGIC that resets all negative values to zero and all values over a given threshold to that threshold. \n",

    "In MAGIC we **do not want to cap the input image unless it has gone through the pipeline** (since seed images will have count rates well into the millions for certain stars) or if we know it is a simulated image. \n"
